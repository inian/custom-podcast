# custom-podcast

Create your own personalised podcasts. 

# Main use case
Watch videos and audio files from my podcast player. My list of watch later videos in Youtube was also increasing by quite a bit. This automatically downloads Youtube videos and adds them to a podcast feed that you can subscribe to. My podcast player is already configured to download (only) on Wifi and this fits my current workflow well.
